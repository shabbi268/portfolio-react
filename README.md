## Docker Setup:
### Docker Image and Container Way:
Follow the below instructions if you want to run the application in an docker container
- Run below command to build the Docker Image:
    `docker build -t <NAME_AS_YOU_WISH>` .
- Run below command to run a container instance of the image created above:
    `docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/app -v /app/node_modules -p 3001:3000 -e CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING=true <CHOOSE_IMAGE_NAME_ABOVE>`
- Now the docker image is created and container instance is up and running.
- Go to the `http://localhost:3001/` and you should see the app running.
- Make sure you go to above url at `3001` because we proxied the port 3000 to 3001 of docker virtual port.

### Docker-Compose way:
Follow the below steps to use docker-compose to run the application in one step:
- Run the below command to build and run the application:
    `docker-compose up -d --build`
- The above command takes care of building image, creating and running the container.

### Pulling the Image from Docker Hub and Running the application

    `docker pull kesash/cloud_poster:version1`
- Run the below command to run the instance of the pulled container
